    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol class="liRecipes">
      <li>
        In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast and a teaspoon of sugar in warm
        water. Let it sit for about 5 minutes until it becomes frothy.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, remaining sugar, salt, and
        lemon zest (if using).
      </li>
      <li>
        Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and pour in the yeast
        mixture. Mix until a sticky dough forms.
      </li>
      <li>Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition.</li>
      <li>
        Cut the butter into small pieces and gradually incorporate it into the
        dough. Knead the dough for about 10 minutes until it becomes smooth and
        elastic.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover the dough with a clean kitchen towel and let it rise in a warm
        place for about 1-2 hours, or until it doubles in size.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to a specified temperature mentioned in the recipe.
      </li>
      <li>Grease a Babà mold or individual Babà molds with butter or oil.</li>
      <li>
        Punch down the dough and divide it into portions, shaping each portion
        into a small ball. Place the balls into the greased molds.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover the molds with a towel and let the dough rise for another 30-45
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake the Babà in the preheated oven for the specified time or until they
        turn golden brown and are cooked through.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the Babà are baking, prepare the syrup by combining sugar and
        water in a saucepan. Bring the mixture to a boil, then remove it from
        heat and stir in the rum or other liqueur.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the Babà are out of the oven, immediately brush them generously
        with the syrup while they are still warm.
      </li>
      <li>
        Let the Babà cool completely in the molds, then remove them gently.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve the Babà Napoletano as is or garnish them with whipped cream,
        fruit, or additional syrup, if desired.
      </li>
